                <h2>What is Co-Make?</h2>
            
                <p>Co-Make is a hub created for local community members in order to identify, prioritize 
                and solve problems in their area. The process is simple: you identify a problem, 
                your community upvotes the issues they find important, and your local government or HOA 
                solves it.</p>
